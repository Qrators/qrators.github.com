You are a talented iOS developer?
Join the Qrators team to help us build the mobile experience of street art discovery. 

*What is Qrators?*

Qrators is a mobile and web app that helps you keep track of the street art pieces you discover. It gives you the information you miss when you come across a nice artwork. Think of it as the Shazam for street art. 

*Why work at Qrators?*

You will get to work with nice people in Paris, and you'll enjoy the environment of RESTful Ruby and appealing APIs, beside the usual perks.

Please drop us a line and include some links to the stuff you've built: <a href="mailto:contact@Qrators.com">contact@Qrators.com</a>.
